# PokeyBots Robotics Code

This code was written for the PokeyBots Robots made by [ABC Robokits](https://abcrobokits.com).  
They utilize  XAIO ESP32C3 boards. These are the basic problems for setup and control of the robots.  
The program `get_mac_address` prints the mac address for the controller board and for the robot board 
to be used in the other two programs.
