# PokeyBots Robotics Code

This code was written for the PokeyBots Robots made by [ABC Robokits](https://abcrobokits.com).  

They utilize  XAIO ESP32C3 boards. These are the basic programs for setup and control of the robots.  The program `get_mac_address` prints the mac address for the controller board and for the robot board  to be used in the other two programs.  The `controller_code` program is the program which will be uploaded to the joystick controller.  The `robot_code` program is the program which will be uploaded to the robot board in the chassis.
